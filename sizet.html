                <p class="ks-project-script">I worked with the client to discover what the main problems they wanted to solve with Sizet were. Previously interior designers had carried around a large book of standard measurements, nicknamed “The Silver Bullet”. Because of the books size it was extremely difficult to find specs on the fly and was cumbersome to carry around. </p>

                <p class="ks-project-script">Starting in sketch form I determined the organization of the app and the general layout. I then moved to wireframing where I used invision to prototype the app and conduct basic user testing. At this point I identified and existing problems and adjusted the apps design accordingly before Stylizing the interface.  </p>
